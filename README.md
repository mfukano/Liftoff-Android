# What is this?

I implemented the Liftoff Android SDK in a demo application written in Kotlin. Currently it supports the following placements:
- Banner
- MREC
- Interstitial
- Rewarded Video

Native ads are a little tricky, and require a little more knowledge about Fragment rendering than I'm currently familiar with.
However, it was an interesting problem to try to solve with Kotlin, a language I'm not highly familiar with. This ecosystem tends
to change quite quickly as well; I was surprised how much had changed with both the language and Android Studio itself, though the
latter for the better.

# How to install

It should be as easy as cloning the repository and opening the directory with Android Studio to generate a build.
If not, please get in touch with me and I'll review the process.
